# Roulette

This is a roulette program that draws a roulette table on the console.  You can't place bets, but it goes through the process and lets you know what bets won after the "ball" finally drops into a bin.

Interstingly, you have the option to make the roulette table any size you want (as long as it fits the size of your console window).  Want to see what a roulette table looks like with 2000 bins, just input your choice and see the madness!
